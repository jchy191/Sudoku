# Sudoku

This is the main project that I would like to showcase. This is a simple game of Sudoku that I wrote recently, using Object-Oriented Programming principles to help organise my code.

The project can be viewed in browser here: 

One thing that I have been working on is improving the readability and organisation of my code. I refactored my code a few times in hopes of achieving this.

Unit testing is something that I am currently learning and I used a test-driven development approach to develop the Solver module. I have yet to learn enough about writing tests for functions that manipulates the DOM, which limited my ability to write tests. In the future, I hope to be able to fully adopt a test-driven development approach in writing my code.

One of the main difficulties was in creating the Sudoku puzzle for hard difficulty. I tried various algorithms 

Features I would like to add in the future include the ability for the player to annotate and add notes while solving the puzzle.
